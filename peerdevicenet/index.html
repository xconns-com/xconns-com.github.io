    PeerDeviceNet provides android runtime/api-library to set up secure
    ad-hoc peer-peer connections among a group of devices and enabling
    communication among them. Its typical use cases cover mobile, P2P,
    M2M, IoT applications. <br>
    <br>
    Its API and protocol is very light weight, and covers peer
    discovery, presence, membership and messaging, similar to MQTT. One
    major difference from MQTT is that MQTT is client-server model; all
    devices connect to server to enable communication among each other.
    PeerDeviceNet enables direct device-device (or peer-peer)
    connections, logically without server in between.<br>
    <br>
    Its API and protocol include the following primitives: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>network detection, connection and disconnection: when device
        is attached to networks or detached from networks. Currently it
        supports wifi, wifi-direct and mobile hotspot. because its
        plugin style implementation, it is easy to add bluetooth or
        other transport. </li>
      <li>peer device discovery: it is designed to enable new ways of
        peer discovery, for example, use new sensors in mobile devices.
        On top of it we built apps using multicast, scanning QR code,
        NFC tapping for peer discovery and connection. </li>
      <li>peer device connection, detection of connecting peers and
        disconnection. </li>
      <li>membership: join/leave app specific communication groups and
        detect peersâ€™s join/leave. </li>
      <li>send/receive messages thru groups.</li>
    </ul>
    The runtime (Router) runs as an android service in a background
    process, while apps invoke its APIs thru AIDL, intents or messenger
    messages.<br>
    <br>
    The runtime (Router) and api library have been published as two
    jar/aar packages at MavenCentral
    (http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|peerdevicenet). and you can
    grab them thru maven or gradle as described in <a
      href="java-api/index.html">JavaAPI doc</a>.<br>
    <br>
    As developers, we find mobile platforms (Android, iOS, Win8) are
    different from traditional platforms (desktops, servers). <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Apps are developed as components glued together thru high
        level communication / integration mechanisms (intents, custom
        urls, contracts), which enables ad-hoc reuse and composition of
        features from different apps. </li>
      <li>Cross components API are mostly asynchronous for the
        responsiveness of apps. </li>
      <li>Many issues become prominent in mobile environments such as
        power conservation, permissions to access device features,
        network connectivity, etc..</li>
    </ul>
    PeerDeviceNet Router internal design and developer API are native to
    the mobile programming model. Its simple intent API allows adding
    remote messaging to apps without any library "gluing"; while its IDL
    interfaces allow apps fine grained control of messaging and
    connection.<br>
    <br>
    PeerDeviceNet api exposes the following three functional modules to
    support connected mobile/P2P apps:<br>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="rmt_intent.html">Remote intenting</a>. intents and
        api to enable remote start of activities and services at peer
        devices, send remote broadcasts.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="grp_comm.html">Group communication</a>. intents and
        api for group membership and message passing.<br>
      </li>
      <li><a href="dev_conn.html">Device connection</a>. intents and api
        for network detection, peer device discovery, peer device
        connection setup.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Each modules are normally supported in three levels of APIs:<br>
    <ol>
      <li>Intent api.&nbsp; <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Intent API provides the highest
      level of access to Router's features. To use this API, all you
      need is to have PeerDeviceNet (Router) installed on users devices
      to gain the runtime support. Apps send normal android intents
      using PeerDeviceNet specific action names and pack message data as
      intent "extra" data items with PeerDeviceNet specific keys. All
      the PeerDeviceNet action names are defined at <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/Router.Intent.html">Router.Intent</a>
      class and "extra" data keys at <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/Router.MsgKey.html">Router.MsgKey</a>
      class which you get when you add the client jar file to your
      project.<br>
    </div>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>IDL api.</li>
    </ol>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">PeerDeviceNet's IDL APIs define
      purely asynchronous methods and callbacks. To access Router
      services thru these apis, you can use client wrapper classes <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/RouterConnectionClient.html">RouterConnectionClient</a>
      and <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/RouterGroupClient.html">RouterGroupClient</a>
      which also handle some common book-keeping for you. There is also
      <a href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/DeviceInfo.html">DeviceInfo</a>
      class and <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/NetInfo.html">NetInfo</a>
      class used at idl api which defines information about devices and
      networks. <br>
    </div>
    <ol start="3">
      <li>Messenger api.</li>
    </ol>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Messenger API is also a high level
      api for apps using android's standard messaging pattern
      "Messenger". This api defines a group of PeerDeviceNet specific
      message ids which can be used with android's Message object. Apps
      use messengers to send message data as a bundle with data items
      using the same key names as Intent api. All the PeerDeviceNet
      message ids are defined at <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/Router.MsgId.html">Router.MsgId</a>
      class and bundle data keys are defined in <a
        href="java-api/com/xconns/peerdevicenet/Router.MsgKey.html">Router.MsgKey</a>
      class.<br>
